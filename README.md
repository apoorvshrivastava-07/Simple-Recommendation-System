# Simple-Recommendation-System
Recommendation systems have changed our day-to-day lives. Be it watching videos online or buying something at Walmart or Amazon, we always get recommendations on what to do next. These recommendations could be based on the popularity of the items or on the history of a userâ€™s consumption of similar items. The latter is what really creates a personalized user experience and increases overall engagement with the product. There are multiple algorithms in the market which does the job to its perfection. In this project, I will investigate one of the key metrics that is generally used to develop a recommendation system: Cosine Similarity.
